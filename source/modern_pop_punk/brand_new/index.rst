About
-----

Consisting of members Jesse Lacey, Vincent Accardi, Brian Lane, and Garrett 
Tierney, Brand New was formed in 2000 after a dispute frontman Jesse Lacey had 
with his best friend and former band mate John Nolan. Brand New’s debut album, 
*Your Favorite Weapon*, came out shortly after the band’s formation and served 
almost solely as a way to get back at Nolan. After its release, Brand New’s 
style would change from a heavily pop-punk influenced emo sound, often dubbed 
as emo pop, to something more along the lines of post-hardcore with the release 
of *Deja Entendu*. While the band isn’t necessarily a strict pop-punk, often 
being described as a post-hardcore and emo band, the group heavily influenced 
the sound of many early 2000s groups. The band has also been praised for their 
lyrical structures and creativity, many citing Lacey as one of the scene’s 
most prominent lyricists. In 2017, Brand New released their highly anticipated 
fifth studio album *Science Fiction*.
