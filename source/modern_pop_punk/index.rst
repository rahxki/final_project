About the Genre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dating back as early as the 1970’s, pop-punk is a genre that fuses more 
accessible, catchy rhythms and melodies of pop with the angst and energy of 
punk music. Though the genre has been around since the 70’s, it really started 
gaining traction in the 90’s with bands such as **blink-182** and 
**Green Day**. This movement bled into the 2000’s getting into more modern day 
pop-punk, which is what the bands being covered here will be classified as. 
Lyrically, the themes found in pop-punk since the 2000’s have heavily consisted 
of things such as loving your friends, a general distaste for one’s hometown, 
growing up, and failing or failed relationships. These themes are so prevalent 
throughout the genre that they’ve become somewhat of a stereotype, and often 
make the genre seem less mature. This and the use of simple song structures 
lead many to believe the genre holds less merit and legitimacy than it’s 
musical peers. However, there are still very important, and heavy hitting 
themes spread across the genre, and many records that are much more complex 
and expansive than the small box some believe the genre fits into. Some such 
albums are **The Wonder Years’s** *No Closer To Heaven*, 
**The Story So Far’s** *Proper Dose*, **Fall Out Boy’s** *Infinity on High* 
and many more.
