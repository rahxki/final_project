About
-----

Formed in 2007 in Walnut Creek, California, The Story So Far has made a big 
name for themselves in the current pop-punk scene. The Story So Far is 
comprised of five members, Parker Cannon, Kevin Geyer, Kelen Capener, Ryan 
Torf and Will Levy. The band has released four studio albums, three eps, and 
three split-eps. Known for their dynamic and animated live performances, The 
Story So Far imbues their music with hardcore-esque energy and heart, quickly 
becoming one of the forerunners of the pop-punk revival. The band’s earlier 
lyrical content heavily consists of Cannon’s anger, grief, and disappointment 
in past relationships. However, their most recent fourth studio record 
*Proper Dose* sees Cannon open up about his substance addiction, writing 
about his desire to recover, and moving on from the anger he once had. Along 
with the change of lyrical content, *Proper Dose* also sees the band moving in 
a direction driven less by Cannon’s rage meaning a change in the band’s overall 
sound, becoming more mellow, but still retaining some of the grit that 
popularized the band.
