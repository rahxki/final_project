Alternative Metal
=========================

A fusion between alternative rock and heavy metal; alternative metal is a style that is united by nonconforming sensibility
in order to produce a unique sound. A common characteristic of Alternative Metal is a heavy downtuned mid paced "chug"-like
Guitar riffs while featuring clean and melodic vocals from alternative rock. Some of these vocals had been mixed with
clearer singing, growling, or screaming. 

It did not become a genre until the 1980s to the mid 1900s where metal was being mixed with funk rock at the time. Some
hardcore bands had adopted the style as well and became very popular while grunge was making traction. This is because
Alternative Metal was preferred over grundge at the time which accelerated the genre's growth in those years.

In the years of its peak, before the current era, nu metal kicked off. It proved to be an overall improvement over
Alternative Metal which forced Alternative Metal in decline.

In the current era alternative metal is being used by bands who are unintentionally using it. Godsmack is one of the bands
who are still classified as alternative metal because of some missing elements. Even more the term alternative metal is
about as meaningfull as alternative rock.

Above are three bands who are examples of Alternative Metal or had performed one alternative metal song in their career. 
They may not be considered Alternative Metal currently but at one point in time they were an Alternative Metal band.
